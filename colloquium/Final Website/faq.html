            <p>
                New Builds NYC is a web portal launched in 2034 in conjunction with DEBUG to better protect NYC residents from misregulated building developments. 
                As part of the approval process, all potential builds must be submitted through this site. 
                Once submitted, our computational model will assess building metrics and publish them for public and committee review.
                The public can use these metrics to reach out to their committee members and inform their vote.
                Elected committee members then vote on which projects will advance based on these metrics.

        <button class="accordion">How is New Builds NYC different from other building analysis tools?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Prior to the implementation of New Builds NYC, there was no requirement for assessing a future build's impact on the local community.
                New Builds NYC sought to change that, and has been implemented in policy as the first tool of its kind required for project approval.

        <button class="accordion">How does New Builds NYC measure building impact? What metrics are being tracked?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                New Builds NYC collects public data from NYC Open Data, P.L.U.T.O., and other historical data sources to create the most up-to-date analysis metrics.
                Metrics include average loss of daily summer shade, average loss of daily winter sunlight, change in average building age, and anticipated rent increase. 
                Developers upload their proposed 3D building design files and which are then imported into our model.
                Our tools use this to calculate these metric results using a combination of Grasshopper and Rhino.

        <button class="accordion">Who developed New Builds NYC?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                In response to the tragic events of 2029, NYC Mayor Hughes commissioned the development of New Builds NYC and the creation of DEBUG, the Department of Equitable Built Urban Growth.
                Computational modeling professionals from Columbia GSAPP and NYU CUSP were contracted to complete the project.

                As a NYC resident, New Builds NYC gives you the power to know and have a say in what is being built in your neighborhood. 
                Updated daily, this site includes potential future build metrics and visualizations, background information, and committee member current positions.
                With this information, you are empowered to selectively choose your DEBUG representatives and contact them should you disagree with their position.

            <p>
                New Builds NYC harnesses location technology to keep individuals updated on future builds in their area. 
                This technology allows us to notify you when a new build is proposed in your area, and send a notification when you pass by a future potential build.
                To opt out of notifications, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@nbnyc" style="color:#9adcfa;">help@nbnyc.gov</a>.
