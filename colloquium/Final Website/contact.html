                <h2>2022</h2>
                <p>In the NYC development process, architects and developers are required to abide by <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/about-zoning.page" style="color:#9adcfa;" target="_blank">zoning rules</a> which consider issues including "building shape, affordable housing, walkability and climate change resiliency". 
                    Essentially, new buildings are only assessed in terms of their self-contained attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In May, Extell Development Company gets the green light to begin work on their new site creating a 39-story (775-foot) residential building at <a href="https://extell.com/portfolio/50-west-66th-street" style="color:#9adcfa;" target="_blank">50 West 66th Street</a>.
                    The site was part of the original ABC campus on the Upper West Side and was formerly owned by Walt Disney Company. 
                    In response, Landmark West, an organization dedicated to building an inclusive community and championing a positive neighborhood quality of life for the Upper West Side of Manhattan filed a case within the NYC Board of Standards and Appeals. 
                    After the court ended deadlocked in a 2-2 tie vote over the fate of the site, Extell Development was given the green light to move forward and Landmark West was denied an appeal, as a tie vote in these cases is awarded to the developer.
                    This was a major blow for Landmark West, but the worst was still yet to come.

                <p>Extell Development finishes work on the residential building, now the tallest on the Upper West Side.</p>

                <p>In a relatively low-density area, this building had an immediate impact on the neighborhood, casting shadows where none were before in the winter and reflecting more light into the street in the summer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But more than this, where local residents were hurt the most was in their wallets. 
                    Despite the surrounding neighborhood's above-average median income of $154,906, the average unit price of $28.5 million for 50 W 66th Street was well beyond their reach.
                    This resulted in a ripple effect of rent raises throughout the neighborhood. As a result, local rent prices increased by an average of 38%, and sell prices soared over 180%.

                    As rents were renewed, the community continued to suffer and several long-term residents were displaced. However this wasn't unusual for New York City, and despite local residents' interviews and posts, news outlets did not pick up the story.
                    However one of the residents who was priced out of the neighborhood was the aunt of Taylor Swift's childhood friend Abigail Anderson. Swift, who as of the 2016 election had become more politically active, began speaking out about the development and its results on the community. 
                    Swift fans, reknowned for both their steadfast support the singer and their overwhelming and sometimes missguided responses to her call to action, began "trolling" the developer on their social media channels.

                    This caught the attention of local news stations, and by October individuals from the city and beyond were gathering to protest developments across the city. In November, one protest over the <a href="https://www.theb1m.com/article/this-supertall-will-dominate-manhattans-skyline-2030" target="_blank" style="color:#9adcfa;">175 Vanderbilt development</a> resulted in the death of two NYU students after being trampled during a crowds' retreat from police presence.
                    This tragedy shook the city and many looked to local government for action.

                <p>Following this tragic event, on January 1 Mayor Hughes was sworn in and immediately announced the creation of a new department dedicated to the prevention of future similar events.

                    DEBUG (the Department of Equitable Built Urban Growth) consists of a committee of elected representatives who voted on the possible plans of NYC developers. But this was not enough. Community members needed to be empowered to make the right decisions on who they elected based on their community needs.
                    To accomplish this, Mayor Hughes also allocated $3 million to the development of computational systems and a public website displaying the resulting metrics for future potential builds, including how each committee members is set to vote on them.

                    Set to launch by 2034, these two projects sought to inform city residents of upcoming projects and give them a say into what did and didn't move forward.

                    In July, the website goes public proir to its requirement in the development process. Information sessions are held across the city throughout the Fall for both residents and developers.
                    Despite some pushback from development companies including Extell, Mayor Hughes pushes forward and delivers several address expressing her stauch support of the programs and their future success.

                    After eight years of these programs, New York City is seeing more restoration projects focused on spaces for things like arts and culture, local businesses, and reasonable residences, and less supertall luxury buildings are popping up (although they are not gone althogether).
                    The first data collection assessing the results of these programs was just released and is accessible at <a href="data.html" style="color:#9adcfa;">this link</a>.
