                <h2>2022</h2>
                <p>In the NYC development process, architects and developers are only required to abide by <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/about-zoning.page" style="color:blue;">zoning rules</a> which consider issues including "building shape, affordable housing, walkability and climate change resiliency". 
                    Essentially, this meant that new buildings were only considered in terms of their self-contained attributes.
                    Extell Development Company get the green light to begin work on their new site creating a 39-story (775-foot) residential building at <a href="https://extell.com/portfolio/50-west-66th-street" style="color:blue;">50 West 66th Street</a>.
                    The site was part of the original ABC campus on the Upper West Side and was formerly owned by Walt Disney Company. For this reason, caught the eye of Landmark West, an organization dedicated to building an inclusive community and championing a positive neighborhood quality of life for the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 
                    They filed a case within the NYC Board of Standards and Appeals, and after the court ended deadlocked in a 2-2 tie vote over the fate of the site Extell Development was given the green light to move forward and Landmark West was denied an appeal, as a tie vote in these cases is awarded to the developer.
                    This was a major blow to the preservation of historical buildings in the UWS, but the worst was still yet to come.
